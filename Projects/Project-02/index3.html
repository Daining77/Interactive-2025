          For some ADHD patients, reading large amounts of text is often difficult. Like a normal person reading blue text on a red background.
          
          <br>
          Sometimes, they use tools to assist their reading, such as highlight text plugins that follow the mouse.

          If you also find it challenging to efficiently finish a book, maybe it's not your fault.

        <p>Although typically diagnosed in children, ADHD often continues into adulthood and is estimated to affect 4.4% of adults in the United States and 5.3% of adults worldwide. </p>
        <p>
          Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)[1] is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation that are excessive and pervasive, impairing in multiple contexts, and developmentally inappropriate.[9] ADHD symptoms arise from executive dysfunction.
        </p>
        
        
      
        
        <p>
          The precise causes of ADHD are unknown in most individual cases.[38][39] Meta-analyses have shown that the disorder is primarily genetic with a heritability rate of 70-80%,[40] where risk factors are highly accumulative.[41] The environmental risks are not related to social or familial factors;[42][43][44] they exert their effects very early in life, in the prenatal or early postnatal period.[8] However, in rare cases, ADHD can be caused by a single event including traumatic brain injury,[40][45][46][47] exposure to biohazards during pregnancy,[8] or a major genetic mutation.[48] As it is a neurodevelopmental disorder, there is no biologically distinct adult-onset ADHD except for when ADHD occurs after traumatic brain injury.[8][49]

        <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
            
            <p>Inattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive behaviour, and impulsivity are common in ADHD.[50][51][52] Academic difficulties are frequent, as are problems with relationships.[51][52][53] The signs and symptoms can be difficult to define, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin.[54]
                <br>
                 According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and its text revision (DSM-5-TR), symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the same age.[4][5] This requires at least six symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity for those under 17 and at least five symptoms for those 17 years or older.[4][5] The symptoms must be present in at least two settings (e.g., social, school, work, or home), and must directly interfere with or reduce quality of functioning.[4] Additionally, several symptoms must have been present before age 12.[5] The DSM-5 's required age of onset of symptoms is 12 years.[4][5][55] However, research indicates the age of onset should not be interpreted as a prerequisite for diagnosis given contextual exceptions.[49]
            </p>
    
        <h3>Presentations</h3>
    
        <p>ADHD is divided into three primary presentations:[5][54]
            <br>
          predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I)
          <br>
          predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI)
          <br>
          combined presentation (ADHD-C).
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The table "Symptoms" lists the symptoms for ADHD-I and ADHD-HI from two major classification systems. Symptoms which can be better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition which an individual has are not considered to be a symptom of ADHD for that person. In DSM-5, subtypes were discarded and reclassified as presentations of the disorder that change over time.
          Girls and women with ADHD tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more symptoms of inattention and distractibility.[56]
    
          Symptoms are expressed differently and more subtly as the individual ages.[57]Hyperactivity tends to become less overt with age and turns into inner restlessness, difficulty relaxing or remaining still, talkativeness or constant mental activity in teens and adults with ADHD.[57]Impulsivity in adulthood may appear as thoughtless behaviour, impatience, irresponsible spending and sensation-seeking behaviours,[57]while inattention may appear as becoming easily bored, difficulty with organization, remaining on task and making decisions, and sensitivity to stress.[57].

        <h3>Characteristics in childhood</h3>
    
        <p>
          Difficulties managing anger are more common in children with ADHD,[58] as are delays in speech, language and motor development.[59][60] Poorer handwriting is more common in children with ADHD.[61] Poor handwriting can be a symptom of ADHD in itself due to decreased attentiveness. When this is a pervasive problem, it may also be attributable to dyslexia[62][63] or dysgraphia. There is significant overlap in the symptomatologies of ADHD, dyslexia, and dysgraphia,[64] and 3 in 10 people diagnosed with dyslexia experience co-occurring ADHD.[65] Although it causes significant difficulty, many children with ADHD have an attention span equal to or greater than that of other children for tasks and subjects they find interesting.[66]
        </p>
        
        <h3>Emotional dysregulation</h3>
    
        <p>
          Although not listed as an official symptom, emotional dysregulation or mood lability is generally understood to be a common symptom of ADHD.[67][68][69][57]
        </p>
    
        <h3>Relationship difficulties</h3>
          
        <p>
             People with ADHD of all ages are more likely to have problems with social skills, such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships.[70] This is true for all presentations. About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social rejection by their peers compared to 10–15% of non-ADHD children and adolescents. People with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction. They may also drift off during conversations, miss social cues, and have trouble learning social skills.[71]
        </p>

        <h3>Hyperfocus</h3>
        <p>An association between ADHD and hyperfocus, a state characterised by intense and narrow concentration on a specific stimulus, object or task for a prolonged period of time,[72] has been widely reported in the popular science press and media.[73] The phenomenon generally occurs when an individual is engaged in activities they find highly interesting, or which provide instant gratification, such as video games or online chatting.[7] Hyperfocus is not a recognised symptom of ADHD in diagnostic manuals, but is frequently referred to as a symptom of ADHD in academic literature[29] and commonly reported in patients with ADHD in clinical practice.[73] There is a lack of research into hyperfocus in ADHD.[29] Studies in 2016, 2019 and 2024 found that individuals with ADHD diagnoses or self-reported ADHD symptoms experience hyperfocus more often,[74][75] or more acutely.[76] A 2020 study did not find a higher frequency of hyperfocus in adults with ADHD, although it reported a positive correlation with self-reported ADHD traits. The discrepancy with other studies may reflect varying definitions and conceptions of hyperfocus.[77]
            <br>
            A state of hyperfocus has been hypothesised as being beneficial, allowing individuals to focus on tasks for much longer than is typical.[29] Conversely, it can be difficult to disengage from and shift attention to other stimuli or tasks, leading to excessively prolonged attention.[72] It is related to risks such as internet addiction (see § Problematic digital media use)[30] and to some types of offending behaviour.[78] Recent research has linked hyperfocus to the psychological concepts of flow, an enjoyable experience of deep engagement in an activity, and perseveration, difficulty disengaging or switching from an activity.[76]
            
        </p>

        <h3>IQ test performance</h3>
        <p>Certain studies have found that people with ADHD tend to have lower scores on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests.[79] The significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with ADHD and the difficulty determining the influence of symptoms, such as distractibility, on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity. In studies of ADHD, higher IQs may be over-represented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower IQs despite those with ADHD scoring on average nine points lower on standardised intelligence measures.[80] However, other studies contradict this, saying that in individuals with high intelligence, there is an increased risk of a missed ADHD diagnosis, possibly because of compensatory strategies in said individuals.[81]
            <br>
            Studies of adults suggest that negative differences in intelligence are not meaningful and may be explained by associated health problems.[82]
